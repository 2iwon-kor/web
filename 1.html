<h2>dongguk동국대학교 WHAT?</h2>
<p>Situated on a hill near Namsan, the university's Seoul campus is
in the urban Jung District of central Seoul. The university's symbol animal
is an elephant, which stemmed from Queen Māyā of Sakya's precognitive dream
of a white elephant about the birth of The Buddha, and the symbol flower is a lotus blossom which reflects the Buddhist truth.[4]<br></p>
